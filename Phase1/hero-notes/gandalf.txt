One of the most powerful Wizards in all Middle-earth, Gandalf the Grey joins the quest to reclaim the Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor and the great treasure that lies within its stone halls from a fire-breating dragon, Smaug the Terrible.
Along the way, Gandalf finds evidence that an ancient evil may have found its way back into the world. So once the dwarven dwellings are secured he will have to make a journey that will take him into the darkest corners of Middle-earth.
