DESC:
Saruman the White was the first of the order of Wizards (or Istari) who came to Middle-earth as Emissaries of the Valar in the Third Age. For a time he was the chief of the Wizards, as well as the head of the White Council.

However, through his appreciation of Sauron's innate strength, his envy of Gandalf and his overbearing hubris, the White Wizard fell into mimicry of the Dark Lord as his capable yet faithless servant, plotting to share in his power or to two-facedly seize the One Ring first.
