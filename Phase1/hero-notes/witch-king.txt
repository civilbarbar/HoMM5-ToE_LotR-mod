DESC:
Some time after Sauron seized the Rings of Power in the Sack of Eregion, S.A. 1697 he gave nine of them to Mannish kings, sorcerers and other warriors. With the power of their rings, the Nine achieved glory and grew wealthy, but they eventually started hating life as they were slowly drawn under Sauron's dominion. In the end, they all became the dreadful Ringwraiths.

The one later known as the Witch-king was a sorcerer, probably one of the unnamed three lords of Númenórean race, who accepted one of the Rings of Power. He first appeared in the histories as a Ringwraith in S.A. 2251. Being the most powerful of the Nazgûl, he became their chief and the most feared servant of his master Sauron.
