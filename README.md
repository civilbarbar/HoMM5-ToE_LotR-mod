# HoMM5-ToE_LotR-mod Readme
Working on a [Heroes of Might and Magic 5 - Tribes of the East] Lord of the Rings Mod.

* Project type: Pet Project - Modifying an existing PC game
## Project goals:
* Phase 1: Building a detailed map of Middle-earth to play on (using the Map Editor provided by the Game Developers).

* Phase 2: Modifying the Game's Visuals and part of it's Mechanics to fit a Lord of the Rings based Setting.

## Implementation:
This project is currently in Phase 1: Building a detailed map of Middle-earth. Work in Progress.

### Developer Notes:
* 2025-06-15: Since the [HoMM5-ToE] mod "MMH5.5" looks like a popular (unofficial) expansion that should fix many balancing issues, I plan to include it for this mod. Link to "MMH5.5": https://www.moddb.com/mods/might-magic-heroes-55
