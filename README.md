# HoMM5-ToE_LotR-mod Readme
Working on a [Heroes of Might and Magic 5 - Tribes of the East] / [Might & Magic Heroes 5.5] Lord of the Rings Mod.

* Project type: Modifying an existing PC game (Pet Project).

## Project goals:
#### * Phase 1: Building a detailed map of Middle-earth to play on (using the Map Editor provided by the Game Developers).

* Phase 1.1: Building the map up to the point where I start work on Phase 2. =DONE!
* Phase 1.2: Picking specific regions to continue on while proceeding with Phase 1 and/or Phase 2(.2).

#### * Phase 2: Modifying the Game's Visuals and part of it's Mechanics to fit a Lord of the Rings based Setting.

* Phase 2.1: Upgrading to [MMH5.5](unofficial expansion mod for [HoMM5-ToE] - Link in Developer Note 2025-06-15 at the bottom of this Readme): From now on this mod project builds on [MMH5.5]. =DONE!
* Phase 2.2: Customizing the main heroes (using [MMH5.5] skill tree/wheel, custom texts and hero portraits). NB: From this point on I will probably start to switch between working on Phase 1 and Phase 2 goals, they are connected.

## Implementation:
This project is currently in Phase 2.2: Customizing the main heroes. Work in Progress.

### Developer Notes:
* 2025-07-18: Horned Demon model and move animations could be a good first fit for Gollum.
* 2025-06-15: Since the [HoMM5-ToE] mod "MMH5.5" looks like a popular (unofficial) expansion that should fix many balancing issues, I plan to include it for this mod. Link to "MMH5.5": https://www.moddb.com/mods/might-magic-heroes-55
